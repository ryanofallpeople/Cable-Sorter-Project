Convert the following two part chatGPT prompt into an generalized interactive prompt that provides enough context for chatGPT to know which questions to ask to eventually generate the requirements.md

Remove all references to tools like NodeJS, and replace, "the cataloging of cables" with "a simple api for cataloging physical objects"

The goal is to make it easy to interactively create a requirements.md for any given project i might be working on.

Ask 5 questions or less but include these two questions at the top of this list:

Ask about what language they are most comfortable in
Ask what they might be cataloging












reformat the previous output into a `gpt_requirements_generator.md` code block.

make sure the actual prompt that is intended to be copied into chat gpt is seperated from the rest of the overview in the .md fille with a line seperator.

Remove the checkboxes and choose a different format for those

Create an unformatted code block for the user to input their answers to be pasted into chatGPT. Make sure that chat gpt knows it will be a multi step interactive prompt.
